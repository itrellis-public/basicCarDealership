# iTrellis Coding Test

## Welcome!

You are free to use whatever libraries, packages, open-source tools, or other developer productivity aids you find helpful. We recommend you **do the coding yourself**. If you engage an AI, you should be prepared to defend any code submitted.

You will need at least the following on your workstation:
- Visual Studio (2022 preferably, Code is probably fine)
- MS SQL Server (developer edition, Express is probably fine)
- MS Teams (for meeting with us for pairing)

## The Test

The first thing to do is to make sure you have the prerequisites (listed above) installed on your workstation, that you can clone and open this solution, and then run the database script(DatabaseSetup.sql).

After that you will pair with an iTrellis dev to add code based on the "Car Dealership" premise below. We find pairing is the best way to know if a candidate will be a fit at iTrellis.

If you want to write code to play around with the car dealership idea and the data before the pairing interview, that's great! Just be prepared to put that work aside if we go in a different direction.


## Car Dealership

A car dealership has a large inventory of cars and needs a tool to help their customers narrow down which cars they could be interested in. Each automobile has several properties that will be used for the search. The manager at the dealership wants to give their customers the option to select 1 or more options as search criteria and give them the option to say that they want any of those options or all of those options.

In other words, a customer should be able to say, "I want my car to have a sun roof, 4 wheel drive, and power windows". The customer should also be able to say "I want a car with navigation, sun roof, or low miles."

Car Options:

Color (Red, White, Gray, Silver, Black)

sun roof

4 wheel drive

low miles

power windows

navigation

heated seats
